# Iguanara App

# Knowing the product
Aiming at the exponential growth of developers in Brazil, we came to the conclusion that many beginner/student developers do not have a portfolio or a web resume where they can assertively demonstrate their information to their audience and recruiters. Iguanara soon emerged, an application that gathers information through GitHub and Linkedin APIs and centralizes this information in an automated way with a few clicks.

# Tools Used
Following the point of ease and simplicity, this project relies on simple dependencies such as Firebase to use Firestore as the application's NoSql database, along with Firebase Auth to gather login information from GitHub and Linkedin.

With this environment, the application is secure in relation to data and also maintains better maintenance and cost, aiming to be in a cloud environment that does not depend on a physical location running the API or application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
